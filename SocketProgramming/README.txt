My project was done running on Mac OS and everything works fine. It is with Python3. The server asks for input of the port number, and after that everything runs on its own. Connect the client to the server using ÒlocalhostÓ as the IP address, and use the port number you entered on the server to connect to the server. You can then begin sending your messages, which should return all of the correct responses.
